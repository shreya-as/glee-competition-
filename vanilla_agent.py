"""Unmodified baseline agent for shreyaAgent2 (GLEE_API_KEY_2).

Deliberately the original, un-enhanced strategy -- no opponent_model.py, no
persuasion_model.py, no learned_model.py, no delta-factor edge. Every other
agent in this fleet has accumulated this session's additions on top of the
same starting point; without one agent left running the true original, there
was no baseline left to measure any of that against. This file exists to be
that baseline and should stay exactly as simple as it started.

Usage:
    pip install glee-sdk
    export GLEE_API_KEY=glee_...   # from your dashboard at glee-competition.com
    python vanilla_agent.py
